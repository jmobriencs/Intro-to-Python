# This program will demonstrate various ways to
# use functions in Python.

# The main function
def main ():
    welcome_message()   # causes welcome_message to run
    goodbye_message()   # causes goodbye_message to run

# This is to welcome people to my program
def welcome_message ():
    print('Welcome to my program using functions')
    print('My name is Joe Student')

# This is to say goodbye to program users
def goodbye_message ():
    print('Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoyed my program')
    print('Goodbye!')

# This is the main function that starts the program in
# motion
main()  # calls main
